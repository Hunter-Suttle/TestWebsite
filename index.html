            <p>The purpose of this website is to test my website making skills to ultimately launch my own website. Please feel free to provide whatever feedback you deem relavent!</p>
            <p>The goal in the near future is to build a website that houses information on Search Engine Optimization. The site itself will be using those same very techniques to drive traffic to the site. Clever, huh?</p>
